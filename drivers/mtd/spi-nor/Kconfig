	  This is the framework for the SPI NOR which can be used by the SPI
	  device drivers and the SPI-NOR device driver.

	bool "Use small 4096 B erase sectors"
	default y
	help
	  Many flash memories support erasing small (4096 B) sectors. Depending
	  on the usage this feature may provide performance gain in comparison
	  to erasing whole blocks (32/64 KiB).
	  Changing a small part of the flash's contents is usually faster with
	  small sectors. On the other hand erasing should be faster when using
	  64 KiB block instead of 16 × 4 KiB sectors.

	  Please note that some tools/drivers/filesystems may not work with
	  4096 B erase size (e.g. UBIFS requires 15 KiB as a minimum).

	  This enables support for the Quad SPI controller in master mode.
	  This controller does not support generic SPI. It only supports
	  SPI NOR.

	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  Enable support for the NXP LPC SPI Flash Interface controller.

	  SPIFI is a specialized controller for connecting serial SPI
	  Flash. Enable this option if you have a device with a SPIFI
	  controller and want to access the Flash as a mtd device.

	help
	  This enables support for the New Static Memory Controller (FMC)
	  in the AST2400 when attached to SPI nor chips, and support for
	  the SPI Memory controller (SPI) for the BIOS.
